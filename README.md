# Company Philosophy

We operate with a high signal-to-noise ratio. We value plain text, simplicity, and directness. Every word must earn its place.

## Principles

### Time
-   **8-8-8**: 8 hours work, 8 hours life, 8 hours sleep.
-   **Boundaries**: Clear start and end times. Respect them.
-   **Deep Work**: 60 continuous minutes beats four 15-minute fragments.
-   **Rest**: Sleep on tough decisions. Morning brings clarity.

### Focus
-   **Limit**: Max 5 active tasks.
-   **Sequential**: Finish one major project before starting another.
-   **Priority**: "No" is no to one thing. "Yes" is no to a lot of things.
-   **Momentum**: Commit 5 minutes to start any task.

### Decisions
-   **Action**: Act swiftly. Most decisions are reversible.
-   **Commitment**: Disagree and commit. Once decided, move as one.

### Communication
-   **Async First**: Real-time is the exception. Reserve it for critical incidents.
-   **Meetings**: Last resort. Write it up instead. Five people in a room for an hour isn’t a one hour meeting, it’s a five hour meeting.
-   **Repetition**: Repeat core ideas until they are part of the culture.
-   **No "Hi"**: Don't ask to ask. State your business immediately.

### Teams
-   **Small**: You can do big things with small teams, but it’s hard to do small things with big teams. 
-   **Respect**: Don't dismiss what you don't understand.

## Methodologies

We operationalize our philosophy through specific frameworks:

-   **[The CASE Method](https://github.com/oktoeight-com/oktoeight-case-method)**: Universal framework for help requests and debugging (Context, Action, Symptom, Evidence).
-   **[The CORE Method](https://github.com/oktoeight-com/oktoeight-core-method)**: Universal framework for prioritization and project management (Confidence, Outcome, Return, Effort).

## Tools

Philosophy on software and hardware.

### Philosophy
-   **Freedom**: Use the tools that make you most effective.
-   **Simplicity**: Prefer tools that are local-first, plain-text, and modular.

## General Software Development Guidelines

Core principles and workflows for software development at Oktoeight.

### Principles

-   **UNIX Philosophy**: Do one thing well. Build small, composable tools.
-   **Suckless Mindset**: Prioritize simplicity, clarity, and minimalism. Avoid bloat and unnecessary abstractions.
-   **Clarity**: Prefer explicit code over "magic". Use meaningful names. Comment only non-obvious logic.
-   **Modularity**: Design single-purpose components.
-   **Efficiency**: Optimize only after identifying bottlenecks.
-   **Consistency**: Adhere strictly to existing patterns and styles within the project.

### Workflow

-   **Plan First**: Outline steps before implementation.
-   **Error Handling**: Handle errors explicitly. Never suppress them.
-   **No Placeholders**: Do not commit temporary or developer-specific code.
-   **Documentation**: Use latest official references.

### Security

-   **Secrets**: Never commit secrets. Use environment variables and `.gitignore`.
-   **Dependencies**: Use trusted, well-maintained libraries.

### Version Control

-   **Commits**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
-   **Changelog**: Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
-   **Versioning**: Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
